## Run the bot yourself

* [Java 8 JDK](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html)
* [git](https://git-scm.com/)
* [gradle](https://gradle.org/)

Also prepare a [MariaDB SQL](https://mariadb.org/) server (either hosted or installed locally).<br/>
Then continue with the following steps.

1. Create a database

    Create a database using the utf8mb4 character set. <br/>
    To make this easier you can do this using a SQL management tool like [PHPMyAdmin](https://www.phpmyadmin.net/) or [HeidiSQL](http://www.heidisql.com/).

2. Clone the project with git

    ```
    cd /path/to/your/project/folder
    git clone https://github.com/Kaaz/DiscordBot.git
    ```  

3. Collect dependencies
    
    `cd` into the directory that git just created (should be called `DiscordBot`).<br>
    Then type `gradle install`.
    
4. Build
    
    Type `gradle shadowJar` in the `DiscordBot` folder.
    In the build/libs/ folder there should be a file called `Emily-{VERSION}-all.jar` (where version is the latest version number).
    Move this file over to a location wherever you want to start the bot from.
    
5. Run

    You can launch the bot with the following command:
    `java -jar <jarfilename>`
    On first launch, It will generate an `application.cfg` file and exit.<br>
    You'll have to edit the config file and add in your token, database configuration, etc.


## Usage

On the first run it will generate a config file and stop running. You'll need to at least set the token and the property **bot_enabled** to true

## Command details

%_COMMANDS_LIST_DETAILS_%


## Global configuration

The global configuration is stored in the application.cfg file, which is generated the first time you run the application
